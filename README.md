This code will show you how to establish connectivity between Snowflake and BizTalk when WCF-SQL adapter does not meet your requirement. Below are the steps to follow :
1.	Install and Configure Snowflake ODBC Driver
o	Obtain the Snowflake ODBC driver from the Snowflake documentation.
o	Install it on the BizTalk Server machine.
2.	Configure ODBC DSN:
o	Open the ODBC Data Source Administrator tool (32-bit or 64-bit based on your BizTalk version).
o	Add a new DSN for Snowflake.
o	Provide the required details:
	DSN Name: A name to identify the connection.
	Server: Snowflake server URL (e.g., account.region.snowflakecomputing.com).
	Database: Default database to connect.
	User: Snowflake username.
	Password: Snowflake password.
	Warehouse: Default warehouse for queries.
o	Test the connection.
3. Configure BizTalk Server
          Create a custom .NET component using the Snowflake Connector for .NET.
   Install Snowflake Connector for .NET:
o	Install the NuGet package:
Install-Package Snowflake.Data
           Develop .NET Component:
o	Write a .NET class to handle Snowflake connections and queries.
o	Please find attached code.
  Call the .NET Component in BizTalk:
•	Deploy the custom assembly.
•	Use a BizTalk orchestration or pipeline to call the component.
4. Test the Integration
Perform end-to-end testing of the data flow between BizTalk Server and Snowflake.
Check for connectivity, query execution, and data transformation.
